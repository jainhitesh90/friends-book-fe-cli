        /> This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (&quot;Statement,&quot; &quot;Terms,&quot; or &quot;SRR&quot;) derives
        from the Friendsbook Principles, and is our terms of service that
        governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Friendsbook, as well as Friendsbook brands, products and
        services, which we call the “Friendsbook Services” or “Services”. By using or accessing

    <div class="mvm uiP fsm">Because Friendsbook provides a wide range of Services, we may ask you to review and
        accept supplemental terms that apply to your interaction with a specific app, product, or service. To the extent
        those supplemental terms conflict with this SRR, the supplemental terms associated with the app, product, or service
        govern with respect to your use of such app, product or service to the extent of the conflict. </div>

        <li ><b>Privacy</b><br /> Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our Data Policy            to make important disclosures about how you can use Friendsbook to share with others and how we collect and can
            use your content and information. We encourage you to read the Data Policy, and
            to use it to help you make informed decisions. <br /> </li>
        <li ><b>Sharing Your Content and Information</b><br /> You own all of the content and information you post on Friendsbook,
            and you can control how it is shared through your privacy and application settings.
            In addition:
            <ol>
                <li> For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (IP content), you specifically
                    give us the following permission, subject to your privacy and
                    application settings: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable,
                    sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection
                    with Friendsbook (IP License). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless
                    your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it. </li>
                <li> When you use an application, the application may ask for your permission to access your content and information
                    as well as content and information that others have shared with you. We require applications to respect
                    your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store,
                    and transfer that content and information. (To learn more about Platform, including how you can control
                    what information other people may share with applications, read our Data Policy                   and Platform Page.)</li>
                <li>
                    When you publish content or information using the Public setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people
                    off of Friendsbook, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and
                    profile picture).</li>
                <li> We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Friendsbook, but you understand that we may use
                    your feedback or suggestions without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation
                    to offer them).<br /> </li>
